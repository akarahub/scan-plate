Plate Detection and Recognition

This script utilizes OpenCV and EasyOCR to detect and read license plates from images. It loads an image, preprocesses it for plate detection, then employs EasyOCR to recognize the text on the detected plate. The code incorporates logging for debugging and error tracking, along with a configuration file for flexible settings.  The process involves contour detection and polygon approximation to refine plate localization and includes text recognition using EasyOCR. The script efficiently handles image loading and provides a robust framework for plate recognition tasks.
